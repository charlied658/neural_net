# Neural Network
```neuralnet.py``` generates a nonlinear (degree 2) halfspace, then trains a neural network to learn that halfspace. It then generates test instances to test the accuracy of the neural net.
- In the graph that is generated, misclassified instances are labeled in yellow

```nonlinearboundary.py``` illustrates how the halfspace is generated. The first two graphs generated show the precise halfspace. The 3rd graph is a 3d plot showing the underlying structure. The halfspace is the 2d cross section of this graph at z=0
